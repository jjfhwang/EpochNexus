# EpochNexus: Distributed Time-Series Data Management

EpochNexus is a robust and scalable system designed for the efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of time-series data. It provides a powerful platform for applications requiring high throughput data ingestion, low latency querying, and reliable data persistence. Built with Go, EpochNexus leverages the language's concurrency features and strong performance characteristics to deliver a solution suitable for demanding real-time monitoring, analytics, and alerting applications.

This project addresses the challenges of managing large volumes of time-series data by offering a distributed architecture that can scale horizontally to accommodate increasing data loads. EpochNexus provides a flexible data model, allowing users to define custom schemas and tags to suit their specific needs. It offers a rich set of query capabilities, including aggregation, filtering, and time-based analysis, empowering users to extract valuable insights from their data. Furthermore, EpochNexus is designed with fault tolerance in mind, ensuring data availability and system resilience in the face of unexpected failures.

EpochNexus is more than just a database; it's a complete ecosystem for time-series data management. It incorporates features for data validation, transformation, and enrichment, enabling users to prepare their data for analysis. Its modular design allows for easy integration with existing monitoring tools, analytics platforms, and alerting systems. By providing a unified platform for managing time-series data, EpochNexus simplifies data pipelines, reduces operational overhead, and accelerates the development of data-driven applications.

## Key Features

*   **Distributed Architecture:** Utilizes a sharded architecture with data replication for high availability and scalability. Data is partitioned across multiple nodes based on configurable hash functions, enabling linear scaling as data volume increases. Replication is achieved through a consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft) for data consistency.

*   **Customizable Data Schema:** Allows users to define custom schemas with support for various data types (integer, float, string, boolean). Each data point can be associated with multiple tags, providing flexible indexing and filtering capabilities. The schema is defined using a declarative configuration language (e.g., YAML or JSON).

*   **High-Performance Query Engine:** Offers a powerful query language inspired by SQL, optimized for time-series data. Supports aggregation functions (e.g., sum, average, min, max), filtering based on tags and timestamps, and time-based analysis (e.g., moving averages, rate calculations). Queries are executed in parallel across the sharded data nodes.

*   **Data Ingestion API:** Provides a RESTful API for ingesting data from various sources. Supports batch ingestion and streaming data ingestion with configurable buffer sizes and retry mechanisms. Data can be ingested in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, Protocol Buffers).

*   **Data Retention Policies:** Allows users to define data retention policies based on time or data size. Automatically deletes old data to manage storage costs and ensure compliance with data governance policies. Implements a tiered storage system, allowing infrequently accessed data to be moved to cheaper storage tiers.

*   **Data Validation and Transformation:** Offers built-in data validation rules to ensure data quality. Supports data transformation functions to clean, normalize, and enrich data during ingestion. Validation and transformation rules are defined using a scripting language (e.g., Lua or Python).

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The core programming language for its performance, concurrency, and reliability. Go's garbage collection and memory management contribute to the system's stability.
*   **gRPC:** Used for inter-process communication between EpochNexus components, providing efficient and reliable data transfer. gRPC leverages Protocol Buffers for data serialization.
*   **Raft Consensus Algorithm (via a Go library):** Ensures data consistency and fault tolerance in the distributed architecture. Raft provides a leader election mechanism and replicates data across multiple nodes.
*   **Protocol Buffers:** Used for defining data schemas and message formats, providing efficient serialization and deserialization. Protocol Buffers ensure data compatibility across different components of the system.
*   **InfluxQL-inspired Query Language:** Provides a familiar and powerful query language for time-series data analysis. The query language is parsed and optimized for efficient execution on the distributed data nodes.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/EpochNexus.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd EpochNexus

3.  Ensure Go is installed and configured correctly.  Check your Go version with:
    go version

4.  Build the project:
    go build -o epochnexus cmd/epochnexus/main.go

5.  Optionally, install the binary to your system's PATH:
    sudo mv epochnexus /usr/local/bin/

## Configuration

EpochNexus can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file (YAML or JSON). The following environment variables are supported:

*   `EPOCHNEXUS_DATA_DIR`: The directory where data is stored (default: `/tmp/epochnexus_data`).
*   `EPOCHNEXUS_BIND_ADDRESS`: The address to bind the server to (default: `0.0.0.0:8080`).
*   `EPOCHNEXUS_RAFT_ADDRESS`: The address for Raft communication (default: `0.0.0.0:9000`).
*   `EPOCHNEXUS_JOIN_ADDRESS`: The address of an existing node to join (optional).

Example of setting environment variables:

export EPOCHNEXUS_DATA_DIR=/opt/epochnexus/data
export EPOCHNEXUS_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8080

## Usage

To start EpochNexus, simply run the executable:

./epochnexus

If you want to join an existing cluster, specify the `EPOCHNEXUS_JOIN_ADDRESS`:

EPOCHNEXUS_JOIN_ADDRESS=192.168.1.100:8080 ./epochnexus

EpochNexus exposes a RESTful API for data ingestion and querying. For example, to ingest data:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"timestamp": 1678886400, "measurement": "cpu_usage", "value": 0.75, "tags": {"host": "server1", "region": "us-east"}}' http://localhost:8080/ingest

To query data:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "SELECT mean(value) FROM cpu_usage WHERE host = \'server1\' AND time > now() - 1h"}' http://localhost:8080/query

Detailed API documentation will be provided in a separate document (API.md). This will include endpoint definitions, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.
