# EpochNexus: Decentralized Crypto Asset Rebalancing

A serverless platform for automated crypto portfolio management, powered by on-chain smart contracts and algorithmic trading.

EpochNexus provides a decentralized solution for rebalancing crypto asset portfolios, eliminating the need for centralized custodians and opaque algorithmic trading platforms. This project leverages the power of serverless functions, allowing for scalable and cost-effective execution of rebalancing strategies. Smart contracts on the blockchain guarantee transparent and verifiable execution of trades, building trust and security within the ecosystem. The core functionality revolves around monitoring portfolio composition, analyzing market data, and triggering automated trades based on pre-defined algorithmic strategies, all while minimizing gas costs through efficient smart contract interactions.

The platform aims to empower individual investors and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to optimize their crypto asset holdings without relying on centralized intermediaries. By using serverless functions, EpochNexus can react to market conditions in real-time, executing trades programmatically based on the defined rebalancing strategy. This removes emotional bias and ensures consistent execution of the chosen investment approach. Furthermore, the on-chain execution guarantees that all transactions are transparent and auditable, providing users with complete control and visibility over their portfolio management. The underlying algorithms are designed to be modular and extensible, enabling users to customize and implement their own proprietary trading strategies.

EpochNexus focuses on minimizing complexity for the end-user. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for configuring rebalancing strategies, specifying asset allocations, and monitoring portfolio performance. Underlying the interface, however, is a robust and highly optimized architecture built on industry-standard technologies. The use of Go for the serverless function logic ensures high performance and efficient resource utilization. The smart contract interface is designed for gas optimization, reducing transaction costs and improving the overall efficiency of the rebalancing process. The result is a system that is both powerful and accessible, enabling a wider audience to participate in automated crypto asset management.

## Key Features

*   **Decentralized Rebalancing Logic:** The core rebalancing logic is executed via on-chain smart contracts, ensuring transparent and verifiable execution. The smart contract contains functions for calculating the required trades to rebalance the portfolio to the target allocation.
*   **Serverless Function Architecture:** Utilizes serverless functions for market data analysis and trade execution triggers, enabling scalability and cost-effectiveness. Go functions are deployed to cloud providers like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
*   **Algorithmic Trading Strategies:** Supports a modular architecture for implementing custom algorithmic trading strategies. Strategies can be defined using a Go interface, allowing for easy addition of new algorithms.
*   **On-Chain Portfolio Monitoring:** Tracks portfolio composition directly on the blockchain using smart contract storage. This allows for real-time monitoring of asset allocation and triggers rebalancing when necessary.
*   **Gas Optimized Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are designed with gas optimization in mind, minimizing transaction costs. Techniques such as batch processing and efficient data storage are employed.
*   **Real-time Market Data Integration:** Integrates with external data providers for real-time market data, ensuring informed trading decisions. Data feeds are consumed using APIs and processed by the serverless functions.
*   **Customizable Rebalancing Parameters:** Allows users to customize rebalancing parameters such as target allocation, tolerance thresholds, and trading frequency. These parameters are stored on-chain and used by the smart contracts.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language for serverless functions, providing performance and efficiency.
*   **Ethereum (or other EVM-compatible blockchain):** The blockchain platform for smart contract execution and on-chain data storage.
*   **Solidity:** The programming language for writing smart contracts.
*   **Web3.js (or ethers.js):** JavaScript libraries for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from serverless functions.
*   **Cloud Provider (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, etc.):** The serverless computing platform for deploying and executing Go functions.
*   **Data Provider API (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, etc.):** External APIs for retrieving real-time market data.

## Installation

1.  **Install Go:** Ensure you have Go installed and configured on your system. You can download Go from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/). After installation, set the `GOPATH` environment variable.

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the EpochNexus repository from GitHub:
    git clone [https://github.com/jjfhwang/EpochNexus.git](https://github.com/jjfhwang/EpochNexus.git)

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Go dependencies:
    cd EpochNexus
    go mod download
    go mod tidy

4.  **Compile Smart Contracts:** Compile the Solidity smart contracts using a Solidity compiler (e.g., `solc`). You will need to install `solc` separately.
    solc contracts/EpochNexus.sol --optimize -o build --bin --abi

5.  **Deploy Smart Contracts:** Deploy the compiled smart contracts to a test network or mainnet using a tool like Remix or Truffle. Note the contract address.

6.  **Set up Serverless Environment:** Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) and set up the necessary infrastructure for deploying serverless functions.

## Configuration

1.  **Environment Variables:** Configure the following environment variables for the serverless functions:

    *   `ETHEREUM_NETWORK`: The Ethereum network to connect to (e.g., `mainnet`, `ropsten`, `goerli`).
    *   `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`: The URL of the Ethereum node to connect to (e.g., Infura, Alchemy).
    *   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the Ethereum account used to sign transactions.
    *   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the deployed EpochNexus smart contract.
    *   `DATA_PROVIDER_API_KEY`: The API key for accessing the chosen market data provider.
    *   `REBALANCING_STRATEGY`: The name of the rebalancing strategy to use (e.g., `simple_rebalance`).

2.  **Configuration File (optional):** You can store configuration settings in a JSON or YAML file instead of environment variables. This can be useful for managing complex configurations. The serverless functions should be modified to read the settings from the configuration file.

## Usage

1.  **Deploy Serverless Functions:** Deploy the Go serverless functions to your chosen cloud provider, ensuring that the environment variables are correctly configured.

2.  **Configure Rebalancing Strategy:** Using a front-end application or directly interacting with the smart contract, configure the desired rebalancing strategy, target asset allocation, and other parameters.

3.  **Monitor Portfolio:** Monitor the portfolio composition on-chain and track the performance of the rebalancing strategy.

Example Go function (pseudocode):

package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "context"
)

func main() {
  ethereumNodeURL := os.Getenv("ETHEREUM_NODE_URL")
  contractAddress := os.Getenv("CONTRACT_ADDRESS")
  fmt.Println("Connecting to:", ethereumNodeURL, "Contract Address:", contractAddress)

  // Connect to Ethereum node and interact with the smart contract.
  // Implement rebalancing logic based on market data and target allocation.
}
